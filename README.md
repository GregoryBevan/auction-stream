# Introduction to Event-Driven Architecture with an Auction Stream Application

## Overview

In this Code Lab, you will learn how to implement an **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)** by developing an auction stream application. EDA is a software design pattern that enables systems to respond to events in real-time, promoting scalability and flexibility. By the end of this lab, you will have a functional auction application that processes bids and item listings through event streams.

## What You'll Learn

- The fundamentals of Event-Driven Architecture and its advantages.
- How to set up and configure event streams for real-time data processing.
- Integrating components to build a cohesive auction stream application.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this lab, ensure you have the following:

- Basic understanding of Event Driven Architecture.
- Familiarity with Kotlin programming language.
- Development environment set up with Docker and IntelliJ or Jetbrain Gateways.
- Knowledge of Docker for containerizing applications.

## Duration

This lab is designed to be completed in approximately **2 hours**, but will be completed with lesson .

## Let's Get Started!

Embark on this journey to build a robust auction stream application and gain hands-on experience with Event-Driven Architecture.
